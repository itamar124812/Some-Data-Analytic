# Some-Data-Analytic
In this project I focused on three goals:
1) Learn to extract new information from existing information and different ways to show it.
2) Strengthen my knowledge of Python and its libraries.
3) Exercise a neural network that will predict results of football games.

To implement those goals I use this website: "https://www.football-data.co.uk/"
On the file soccer data export I wrote software that goes through the files and extract that year's league table and Home/Away stats like that:

(in the NewDoc directory presented all the files that I created).

In the two other files I build a nural network that relies on past results will predict game results.
